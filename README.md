# aws-sdk-delphi-samples
Sample projects demonstrating Appercept AWS SDK for Delphi.
Each of these sample projects demonstrates a feature or technique of using Amazon Web Services with Delphi and the Appercept AWS SDK.

## Prerequisites
### AWS Account
To run these samples, you will need an AWS account. If you don’t already have one, you can head over to the [AWS Management Console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/ "AWS Management Console") and sign-up.

### AWS Credentials
For the sample programs to run on your local machine, they need to be configured with AWS credentials for access to the relevant services. While AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is beyond the scope of this article, you will need to create an “Access Key” for a user with the relevant permissions. You can find more details on this in the [AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html). Once you have an access key, you will need to configure your local machine. Details of configuration options can be found in the [Appercept AWS SDK documentation](https://docs.appercept.com/aws-sdk/Configuration.html).

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Browse the projects and check the README files for details of each project.

## Costs
These samples interact with your AWS account, and you may incur costs associated with the services accessed. Many of these services demonstrated have a [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free "AWS Free Tier") that may let you run these samples without charge. You should understand the cost model for the services you intend to use. Please keep track of any resources you create and delete/remove them appropriately so you do not incur any unexpected costs.
